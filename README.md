Graceful Degration and service worker is related because graceful degration is about making sure that the application/software will work properly under different conditions. Since service worker is able to allow the website to function properly even without network, it is a method of graceful degration since having no internet access is a condition that our users might face. In that situation, service worker will be a key factor that allows the user to still able to use the website, hence they are related because they work together to ensure that users will still have a functional website, which is what we want to achieve with graceful degration.
